Story:
As a Gmail account holder,
I want to send an email with an image attachment
so the recipient can view and download the image.

  Normal Flow: Send the email after attaching an image file and writing the recipient and the subject
    Given I am on a Gmail page
    And I am logged in
    And an empty "New Message" window is opened
    When I write the email of the recipient
    And I write the subject
    And I attach an image file
    And I press "Send"
    Then the email should be sent
    And I should see it in the sent mailbox

  Alternate Flow: Send the email after attaching an image file and writing the recipient but not the subject
    Given I am logged in
    And an empty "New Message" window is opened
    When I write the email of the recipient
    And I attach an image file
    And I press "Send"
    Then I should be asked if I want to send the email without a subject
    When I press "OK"
    Then the email should be sent
    And I should see it in the sent mailbox

  Error Flow: Send the email after attaching an image file with size less than 25MB without writing the recipient
    Given I am logged in
    And an empty "New Message" window is opened
    When I attach an image file
    And I press "Send"
    Then my email is not sent
    And I should see an error message saying that I did not input a recipient
